Standard users have no access to the VSS. Administrators have access to vssadmin, which can be used to create, list, and recover data from a shadow copy. 

It is possible to list and recover individual files from the VSS, as per the three-step process below:

vssadmin list shadows
set VSHADOW_DEVICE=\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1
for /R %VSHADOW_DEVICE%\ %i in (*) do @echo %i
