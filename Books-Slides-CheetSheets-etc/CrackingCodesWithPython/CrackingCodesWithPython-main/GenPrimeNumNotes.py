# Prime NUmbers are greater that 1, has ONLY 2 factors: 1 and itself
# if a number has a factor of 1 and itself it's a PRIME# i.e. 2 is a prime #
# 1 is NOT a prime #
# infinite # of prime #'
# Public Key Cipher = uses Large Prime Numbers to ,ale it impossible to Brute Force
# Prime # are diffivult to find, and public key prime #'s are even harder to find
# PRIMALITY TEST
#   We will find a Ranom large prime # and check whether the # is prime with PRIMALITY TEST
#   if # is prime we will use it, if not we will continue to find a larger prime #

# GOOGOL 'Google' is 10 raised to the power of 100 & is writtem 1 with 100 hundred 0's behind it
#   A billion, billion, billion GOOGOLs have 27 more zeros than a GOOGOL & is considered a TINY number
#   compaired to the PRIME # used in the PUBLIC KEY CIPHER
#
# Multiplying 2 PRIME numbers, should result in a number whose FACTORS are only 1, the # itelf and the 2 prime numberes multiplied to
#   get the number..I.E. 3 X 7 = 21     Factors of 21 are 1, (3), (7), 21
#
#Composite Numbers = are INTEGERS that are NOT Prime #'s 
#   every COMPOSITE NUMBER has a PRIME FACTORIZATION, which is a factorization composed of only prime numbers. 2,3,7,11 because 2x3x3x7x11= #   1386

# ****  MULTIPLYING 2 PRIME NUMBERS RESULTS IN A COMPOSITE NUMBER  ****
