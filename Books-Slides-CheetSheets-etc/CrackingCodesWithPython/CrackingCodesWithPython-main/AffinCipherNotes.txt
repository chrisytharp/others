#                       Multiplicative Cipher reqs. KEY [num1] & Symbol Set Size[num2] to be relatively prime "coprime" | GCD(num1, num2) == 1 |
#                                   NOTE: num1 and num2 NEED to be coprime but DONT need to be Prime Numbers
#                                       Coprime numbers are 2 number where the GCD is 1
