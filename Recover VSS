Standard users have no access to the VSS. Administrators have access to vssadmin, which can be used to create, list, and recover data from a shadow copy. 

It is possible to list and recover individual files from the VSS, as per the three-step process below:

vssadmin list shadows

mklink /D \Shadow \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\                (Creates a Link: Maps the shadow to drive )

cd /Shadow/                                                                       (changes dir to C:\Shadow\

dir /Shadow/Users                                                                 (Lists shadows Users Dir)
